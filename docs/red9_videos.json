The new setup, like the existing 'Interactive Curve Filter' from StudioPack offers live editing, enabling you to drag the sliders and have the curve adapt on the fly. The key to this tool is the quality of the re-sampled curve data itself!"

This is a huge deal for animators going between MotionBuilder and Maya as we can now resolve the spine data far more accurately.\nLimb System matching including new toe rotate resolving. This enables twist added to the FK to be by-passed and also all random FK toe data to be pushed directly back to the ik solutions.\nAutoClav resolving and matching for the Red9 PuppetRig, allowing us to finally fully match the arm systems regardless of the state of the Auto-Clav solvers\nNew ParentSpace matching added to the toolsets so we can switch the world space of any of the ik control systems over time with compensation."

It also meant that you couldn't just push an entire animation to a given state if that anim already had numerous IKFK switching happening.\n\nThis is where the concept of IKFK Casting comes in. With casting we cache the end solve of the limb, regardless of it's IKFK state, then switch the relevant system to match that cached data. Simple concept yet very powerful!"

Initially this was to speed up the way we saved layer data which previously passed through Maya's own anim layer merge code but that can be very slow. Since developing this we've decided that animation data, regardless of what's driving it, should always be capable of loading back to a fresh rig exactly as it was saved. The sampler does this as it basically saves out baked data, but only where that's needed."

Perfect for mid-range cutscenes or projects that can't run to the expense of full performance capture. Initially developed to help us test our own Red9 Facial Rigs, TalkBack has matured into a huge system that we're now offering clients. We've already run through a number of high end game projects (all awaiting release) as well as several VFX projects. The system is flexible enough to also produce accurate results on cartoon data and the more we process, the better the learning algorithms get.\nFor more information please contact us to see how we could help streamline your production!"

Initially designed for Cloud Imperium Games who wanted to track facial performance capture, on-mass, from an EDL and master video edit of all the Headcam footage from an entire days performance shoot. This is very relevant to anybody dealing with mass facial performance data.\n\nNote that the export ranges in the UI were actually extracted from the original offline EDL itself"

        "info": "This is probably the most used tool in the entire StudioPack. Track and Stabilizer is used to final anim shots, track objects, maintain contact points and just help you animators out. No need to manage complex constraint switching, just track objects live to create your animation data. If we had a a penny for each time this was used in production we'd be living on a desert island!"

This is done by pushing the animation of the character from it's various child controls, over to the top controller in the rig and recalculating the rest of the data accordingly. The process is 2 way, you can easily go back and forth at the click of a button."

Each video on our YouTube channel is cataloged and indexed by tag, chapter and description making it a great resource. What's more the search field can take multiple strings, 'exp,fbx' will search for all matches of 'exp' and 'fbx', where 'exp+fbx' will search only those making both exp and fbx. This also takes regex entries for more advanced users."
